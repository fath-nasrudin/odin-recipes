    <h1>Sop Buntut</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my version of Indonesian sop buntut, a deeply comforting oxtail and vegetable soup. Rich in collagen and
      filled with complex flavors, I always serve this with steamed rice and extra sliced tomatoes, fish sauce, shallot
      flakes (or French-fried onions), and lime wedges on the side.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 shallots, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>1 large onion, quartered, divided</li>
      <li>1 (2 inch) piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced across the grain</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
      <li>6 whole cloves (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 pounds meaty oxtail pieces, at room temperature</li>
      <li>3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 large carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces, divided</li>
      <li>4 cups water, or as needed to cover</li>
      <li>3 waxy potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks</li>
      <li>3 large carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>3 ripe roma tomatoes, sliced horizontally into 1/2-inch wedges</li>
      <li>1 (2.8 ounce) can French-fried onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine shallots, 2 onion quarters, ginger, and garlic in a food processor; pulse into a paste.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; cook and stir cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon until fragrant,
        about 30 seconds. Add shallot paste and fry until fragrant and slightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add oxtails;
        cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir remaining onion quarters, celery, and 2 carrots into the pot. Pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches.
        Bring
        to a boil; reduce heat, cover, and simmer until oxtail is tender, about 5 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Stir potatoes, 3 carrots, salt, and black pepper into the pot. Increase heat and simmer soup until potatoes
        and
        carrots are tender, about 15 minutes. Add sugar and fish sauce; stir well to combine.
      </li>
      <li> Ladle soup into large serving bowls; top with tomato wedges and French-fried onions.
